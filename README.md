# Vietnamese_stocks_forecasting
The side project of what I learned: Data Analyst, multiple multivariate time series forecasting with Pytorch forecasting and MLOps

# DATASET
For EDA, I would use the stock data from Vietstock via vnstock package. However, I want to show more of what I learned in the past years so I will create  a fake database (pull data from vnstock and then store them as csv file). I will take the data I need from csv file. If I have free time, I would store it as sql Database and use sql to query the data I need

Remember that some of the tricks here might not neccessary for this data. It just to sum up what I could do!
